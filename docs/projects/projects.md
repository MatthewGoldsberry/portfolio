## CubeCats Satellite

CubeCats is a student-led satellite research organization at the University of Cincinnati. The team recently completed and delivered its first CubeSat, scheduled for launch later this year.

I have contributed primarily as a member of the On-Board Computer (OBC) team, where I worked on low-level software responsible for interfacing with satellite hardware components. I am now starting development with the ground station software to enable reliable satellite communication and data ingestion for server-side analysis.

## [Smart Pong](./smart-pong.md)

**Smart Pong** is an AI-driven project completed through the [Discovery Lab Global](https://www.discoverylabglobal.com/) AI program following my freshman year. At the time, I had limited prior experience with both programming and machine learning.

The goal was to design an **autonomous Pong paddle controller** using an AI-based approach, with full ownership over research, implementation, and experimentation. I implemented a **Q-learning reinforcement learning agent**, training it to learn optimal paddle behavior through iterative gameplay.
